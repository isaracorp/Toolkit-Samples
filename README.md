# Toolkit-Samples

> The ISARA Radiate Security Solution Suite offers an implementation of
> cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum computer attacks through a
> lightweight library with a C language interface. This toolkit is the first
> opportunity for customers to start deploying quantum resistant technology in
> a variety of commercial solutions, through drop-in algorithm replacements
> that allow them to build products with an emphasis on quality assurance and
> efficient integration.

## ISARA Radiate Security Solution Suite 1.5 Samples

These samples all require version 1.5 of our toolkit; for more information,
visit [www.isara.com](https://www.isara.com) or contact our
[sales team](mailto:quantumsafe@isara.com).

Each sample demonstrates one part of the toolkit. We use the Dilithium samples
to produce digital signatures of the toolkit's installation packages, for
example.

### Building Samples

We've switched to building the samples all at once with `cmake`. You can still
build them separately using the `CMakeLists.txt` found in each directory.

*NOTE*

> Before building the samples, copy one of the CPU-specific versions of the
> toolkit libraries into a `lib` directory. For example, to build the samples
> for Intel Core 2 or better CPUs, copy the contents of `lib_core2` into `lib`.

To build the samples:

1. Install the toolkit somewhere, e.g. `/path/to/toolkitroot/`.
2. `cd` to the sample subdirectory, such as `/path/to/samples/`.
3. Run CMake: `cmake -DIQR_TOOLKIT_ROOT=/path/to/toolkitroot/ .` or
`IQR_TOOLKIT_ROOT=/path/to/toolkitroot cmake .`
4. Run make: `make`

For more details and tool requirements, please refer to the
_[Developer's Guide](https://www.isara.com/toolkit/1.4/doc/guide/guide.html)_
documentation.

The samples use the `IQR_TOOLKIT_ROOT` CMake or environment variable to
determine the location of the toolkit to build against. CMake requires that
environment variables are set on the same line as the CMake command, or are
exported environment variables in order to be read properly.

### Running Samples

See the individual `README.md` files in the sample subdirectories for
instructions on running specific samples.
