# ISARA Radiate(TM) Crypto Suite 2.0 Version Sample

## Getting Started

We have created a sample application that demonstrates how to use the
toolkit's version information.

Build the sample application in a `build` directory:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DIQR_TOOLKIT_ROOT=/path/to/toolkitroot/ ..
$ make
```

Execute `version`. It has no parameters.

## Further Reading

* See `iqr_version.h` in the toolkit's `include` directory.
